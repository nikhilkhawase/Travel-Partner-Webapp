# Travel Partner Webapp

We are planning to build a web based application called "Travel Partner". herein, we are planning to add such a features to the website where we will just type the name of a tourist destination and we the webapp should line-up all the details regarding that place. Specifically, I want it to mention a travel plan, places to visit, hotel recommendations, transport options, best time to visit, estimated cost of the trip and some cheap alternatives for hotels and food.

## I am building this app with the help of Copilot and chatGPT. I am aiming to not write a single line of code myself, insted, the Copilot should give it to me. 
As of yet, I have been able to build a basic syntax for the idea. The problem I am facing is while using APIs to scrape the data from the API websites. Thi is something I ave to learn and then make some changes.
I am using Visual Studio as the code editor. additionally,  node.js and Command Prompt are used where required. The commands to be used in cmd are also extracted using Copilot.
